# Codility Solutions

This repository contains my solutions to various coding exercises from Codility. These solutions represent some of the possible ways to approach the challenges presented by Codility's lessons.

## Structure

The repository is organized into two main directories:

- `Codility` - This directory contains solution files for each exercise.

- `CodilityUnitTests` â€“ This directory contains unit tests corresponding to each solution file in the 'Codility' directory.

## Contribution

I am open to any contributions that can improve the code. If you have alternative solutions or enhancements, feel free to fork this repository and submit your pull request!

Thank you for visiting this repository, and I hope it helps you on your journey through Codility's challenges!
